            <p>BBQ beef brisket is one of my favorite meals to cook! the process itself takes many hours and can go wrong instantly, but its worth learning to make i the end.</p>
            <p>The recipe requires access to a BBQ smoker, a good choice of wood and dry rub, butcher paper, a dry cooler, and of course a nice cut of brisket.</p>
            <p>Most of the work is going to be done upfront, at the beginning of the cook. Lets get started!</p>
